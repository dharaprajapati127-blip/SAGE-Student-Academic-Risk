SAGE is a faculty-assisted AI early-warning and decision-support system designed to identify early academic risk and burnout indicators in university students.

The system analyzes academic performance, engagement behavior, and well-being signals to generate explainable risk alerts that support timely faculty intervention — with a strong emphasis on human-in-the-loop decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Identify students at **Low / Medium / High academic risk**
- Detect early burnout indicators using non-invasive data
- Provide interpretable and ethical predictions
- Support early intervention by educators and counselors

## 🏗️ System Perspective

SAGE is designed as a decision-support system rather than a standalone prediction model.

The system consists of:
- An intelligence layer for academic and burnout risk prediction
- A faculty alert layer that prioritizes students based on risk severity
- A human-in-the-loop intervention workflow to ensure ethical and responsible use

Faculty members remain central to all decisions, with AI serving as an assistive tool.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

Each row represents a student record with the following features:

- Attendance percentage
- Internal assessment marks
- Assignment submission delay
- Weekly study hours
- Self-reported stress level (1–5)
- Self-reported sleep quality (1–5)

The dataset is currently **synthetic and simulated** to model realistic academic patterns while preserving privacy.
